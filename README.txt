The first stap of doing this project is, is analysing al the documentation that I has about the soldering station. When I did this I made a schematic with all the steps I need to do in it. I did this because it helps me realize this project. Based on this schematic I can control myself. 

When I was making a schematic I found that some components where not so eassy to find. For these special components I needed to download libraries and import them in to the program that I used for designing the PCB.

The program that I used for making the schematic is Altium. This program is verry handy when it comes to place components and making a schematic of it all. When the schematic is finished, Altium is also used for designing the PCB-board. You can easily make an PCB by just place your components on the PCB-design. When all the components are placed, it is just a matter of connecting the components. When this is done the PCB-design is ready for the making stage.  

The program that I used for all of this is a program that we need to use because schools tells us to. I can assume that this is the best program available to do this kind of work. I have searched for other programs to design PCBâ€™s but Altium is the best I could find. 

To design the case for the PCB-design I used the program AutoCad 2021. Making an 3D-object with this program is easily. You need to make a 2D-dising first. When this is done you can make an 3D-file out of it. When the case is designed, I will let it print on a 3D-printer. With the 3D-print technique it is possible to make a lot of different designs and to realize them. The material that the printer will use to make the case is plastic. For my purpose is this more than strong enough. Because I use plastic this will reduce the cost of the whole project.
